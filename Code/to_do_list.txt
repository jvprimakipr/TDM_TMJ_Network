Done:

Show the number of nodes and edges
Compute the density of edges in the network (divide the number of edges by the total number of possible pairs in the network)
Compute the average degree
Compute the standard deviation of the degree
Build the list of degree probabilities
Plot the degree distribution
Plot your network
Diameter of the graph
Number of connected components
Bridges of the network
Obtain the maximum degree of the network
Compute the average distance of the network.
    Is it an ultra-small world, small world or anomalous network? (to do)
    
Histogram of the clustering coefficients of the network
Average clustering coefficient of the graph
Global clustering coefficient of the network
Suppose that it is an Erdös-Rényi graph. What is the estimated probability p of having an edge between two nodes?
    Generate a random graph with the same number of vertices and the same p
    Compare the degree distribution of the random network to the degree distribution of your dataset

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To do:

Fit the power law distribution to your network. What is the resulting alpha?
    Compare the estimated degree distribution with the power law distribution
    Do a bootstrap procedure to test the goodness of fit (tip: check the function numpy.random.choice to generate the bootstrap samples, and powerlaw.power_law_ks_distance to compute the Kormogorov-Smirnov distance). For more details, see "Advanced Topics 4.C" in Barabasi's book.
    Compare it to the expected size according to the power law degree distribution
